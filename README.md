# News-project
This was the last project I tackled in the ItSchool course. It's a website where news is posted - i opted for tech and football news, but other areas can be added. The technologies used were Html, Css (Boostrap), JavaScript, React.

You can see details about every news by clicking on it. Also, on details section you can add the news to favorite and you have different link you can acces if you need more information about it.
With this app you can stay up-to-date with all the news.
Below I attach the Netlify link where you can see a live demo of the application.

## Installation and Setup Instruction

To run this project will need to follow these steps:
1.Clone this repository. You will ned node and npm installed globally on your machine.

2.Change directory: 
cd real-estate-main 

3. Install dependencies:
### `npm i`
To start the server:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Features 
Some features that will be implementing in the futured:
1. Add a new category of news.
